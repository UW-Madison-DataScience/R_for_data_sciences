        Presentation](http://www.vince.vu/talks/): Each frame of Vince's
        talk animations corresponds to a different estimate along the
        solution path of the FPS estimator, plotted as biplots using
        [ggbiplot](https://github.com/vqv/ggbiplot). Each frame was
        saved as a PNG file, and the sequence converted using
        [ffmpeg](http://www.ffmpeg.org) into a movie file as described
        in the [WikiBooks ffmpeg
        Guide](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/FFMPEG_An_Intermediate_Guide/image_sequence).
