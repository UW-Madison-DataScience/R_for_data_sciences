GitHub seems to be the best version control system. It was designed by Linus Torvalds to solve a problem of sharing ideas in the development of Linux (see [TED interview with Linus Torvalds](https://www.ted.com/talks/linus_torvalds_the_mind_behind_linux)).
While GitHub can be used for any type of documents, the `RStudio` folks have made elegant and easy connections.

## Using Github for Pull Requests

Collaboration using version control is widespread and important.
However, it can be painful at times. Here are some code and links

### Add upstream source

This example uses [Data Carpentry](http://datacarpentry.org) protocols (such as `gh-pages` rather than `master` for main page). Here `upstream` is the source repository, `origin` is your copy of the repository on GitHub, and `gh-pages` is the local copy of the main branch of your repository.

Add the `upstream` source; pull contents into `gh-pages`; force the changes to be pushed to `origin`.

```
git remote add upstream https://github.com/datacarpentry/OpenRefine-ecology-lesson.git
git remote -v
git pull upstream gh-pages
git push --force origin gh-pages
```

## Merge branch named `branch` into `master`

```
git checkout master
git pull
git checkout branch
git merge master
``

## Reset Master

This is a DANGEROUS thing to do as it is irreversible. ALWAYS cache a copy before doing something like this.
