-   Technical Writing:
    -   [LaTeX](/network-skills/latex) has for years been the standard
        for writing beautiful math expressions and with the advent of
        versions like pdflatex, xelatex and lualatex it is very
        convenient to produce PDF files. The big drawback to PDF is that
        the formatting is fixed in the file - you can't "reflow" the
        text. HTML and epub formats allow reflowing of text so that you
        can easily read a document on a tablet or even a smartphone.
        However, you usually lose the beautiful math formatting.
    -   [MathJax.org](http://mathjax.org) provides a way of
        incorporating high-quality math expressions in HTML for reading
        in a browser. The Rmd translator built into RStudio allows the
        use of MathJax markup, which is essentially the same as LaTeX
        expressions. MathJax is also available in IPython notebooks and
        IJulia notebooks. These are interactive web documents but can be
        converted to static HTML pages. Doug Bates created [Mathjax
        static HTML for the MixedModels.jl Julia
        package](http://dmbates.github.io/MixedModels.jl/). Wes Brooks
        included [MathJax typesetting in a blog written in Markdown and
        served via
        Django](http://somesquares.org/blog/2013/4/integrating-mathjax-and-markdown-django).
