**Learning Objectives:** After completing this material, an individual will be able to
organize data tasks in a variety of ways.

- document ongoing work with [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/)
- create [functions](function.Rmd) to collapse repeated steps into one-line "verbs"
- use [git and github](http://happygitwithr.com/) to keep track of code and document changes with version control
- organize documentation and data tasks into [packages](package.Rmd) (`R` libraries) to share
- create and manage external [database](database.md) with `R` objects
    + see [databases](https://db.rstudio.com/)
    + understand use and limitations of CSV and XLS file formats
    + understand and use SQLite in `R`; learn about DBI, dbplyr
    + understand and use [RDS](http://www.fromthebottomoftheheap.net/2012/04/01/saving-and-loading-r-objects/) and [feather](https://github.com/wesm/feather) formats
