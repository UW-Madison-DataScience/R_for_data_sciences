The `R` computing environment uses packages to organize objects into discrete sets. A package may have a combination of functions and datasets. The `base` package has the basic `R` tools.

Packages are collections of R functions, data, and compiled code in a well-defined format. Packages are installed onto your computer with `install.packages()`, which is done once. Packages are updated with `update.packages()`. Both these operations can be done within Rstudio from the `Packages` tab in the bottom-right pane of Rstudio.

The directory where packages are stored on your computer is called the library. Packages are attached from the library to your current workspace using the command `library()`. For more information see [packages vs. libraries](https://www.r-bloggers.com/packages-v-libraries-in-r/) and links therein.

To see what packages are attached, use

```{r sessionInfo}
sessionInfo()
```

The other packages automatically loaded are usually `stats` and `graphics`, and some other more arkane helpers, `grDevices`, `utils`, and `methods`.
Note that a number of packages may be `loaded via a namespace (and not attached)`, which means they are used indirectly by some other attached package. Each package has appended its version number after `-`.

## The `datasets` package

All `R` distributions provide the `datasets` packages which only contains sample datasets.
In an interactive session `help` will bring up the index of help pages for the `datasets` package.

This is a collection of datasets, each organized in the basic tabular data structure (rows correspond to observations, columns to variables) called a `data.frame` in `R`.

```{r}
help(package="datasets")
```

An alternative is to list the names of objects in a package. Here we use the `pattern` to just show datasets beginning with `a`.

```{r lsdatasets}
ls("package:datasets", pattern = "^a")
```

Often of more interest, list the names and a brief description of the structure

```{r lsstrdatasets}
ls.str("package:datasets", pattern = "^a")
```

When examining a new `R` package, `ls.str` is a useful way to learn about what objects are in a package. It will list both datasets and functions. However, it can still be rather verbose; it is often better to use the `Packages` tab in the bottom-right pane of Rstudio. You will find a list of objects with one-line descriptions, and help page for each object by clicking on its name. Often, packages have overview documentation toward the top.

Note that in the calls to `ls` and `ls.str` the package name is given as a character string `"package:datasets"`.  This convention is also used in describing which packages are attached in a session. 

## Namespaces and Indirect Access to Packages

Most packages have a [namespace](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/namespace.html), which identifies which objects are visible to users. This is a rather arkane topic, but is important to understand for those going on to develop their own packages.

Normally, one attaches a package using the `library` command, which gives direct access to all objects identified in the namespace of that package. It is possible to access objects in a package _without_ attaching the package by using the convention `packagename::objectname`. For instance, the following makes explicit reference to the package `datasets` to examine the structure of `ToothGrowth`.

```{r Tooth}
str(datasets::ToothGrowth)
```

This is not necessary for already attached packages (such as `datasets`), but can be helpful to document the source of objects. It is generally used in packages that may use a few functions or datasets from another package. For instance, attaching the `dplyr` package makes the `magrittr` pipe (`%>%`) available, without explicitly requiring the loading of this secondary package.

## Miscellaneous Notes

motivation for creating packages

- Fritz Leisch, Kurt Hornik: [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/), package format
- built on [CPAN](http://www.cpan.org/), [CTAN](https://www.ctan.org/?lang=en)
- CRAN mirrors


R source package contents

- `DESCRIPTION` text file
- folders: `R`, `man`, `data`
- optional folders for added documentation: `inst`, `vignettes`
    + `inst` typically has sub-folder `doc` with `Rmd` files, etc.
- optional files: `NAMESPACE`
- `README.md`
- Rstudio project file: `myname.Rproj`
- `LICENSE`

R installed package contents

- takes source and moves to another place
