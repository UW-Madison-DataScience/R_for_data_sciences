Diagnostics and testing

- where are bottlenecks: `system.time()` and `Rprof()`
- what is broken: `traceback()` and `debug()`
- does it do what I want:
    + informal unit testing of small pieces of code
    + using [testthat](https://github.com/hadley/testthat) package
    
Several issues of code efficiency come up:

- cautions on using `for` and `while` loops (see [data lesson](../curate/data.Rmd))
- comparing floating point numbers: `all.equal()` and `1L`
- R profiling of code with Rprof() (before optimizing)

[Travis Continuous Integration](https://travis-ci.org/) works with packages on github to make sure code works as expected each time it is changed. For `R`, this is often used in conjunction with [testthat](https://github.com/hadley/testthat). However, Travis/CI works for a wide range of software languages and platforms.
