**Learning Objectives:** After completing this material, an individual will be able to
profile code to do the following:

- use code profiling tools to identify bottlenecks and logic errors
    + traceback, browser, [Rmarkdown breakpoints](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/205612627-Debugging-with-RStudio)
    + [Rprof](https://www.r-bloggers.com/profiling-r-code/), [profviz](https://rstudio.github.io/profvis/)
    + [Optimizing code](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Profiling.html)
    + package build and checking; TravisCI
- use simulation to study statistical properties
    + examine speed of simulations
    + simulate linear model fits
- create graphics to diagnose patterns in raw and derived data
