Analyze data with linear and other models

This material is in a very early stage. It is not clear how complete this will be,
as the focus of this material is to provide advanced access to R as an interactive
environment, rather than focus on statistical methods. See some of the
[references](../reference.md) for links to more complete material.

**Learning Objectives:** After completing this material, an individual will be able to
do first steps to analyze data in `R`.

- correlate measurements and compare across groups using linear models
- develop annotated plots that reflect project design
- organize linear model results with [broom](https://github.com/tidyverse/broom), [car](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/car/index.html), or [lsmeans](https://github.com/rvlenth/lsmeans) packages
- clustering and trees, building networks
- models that are not linear: generalized linear models, non-linear models
- formulas
