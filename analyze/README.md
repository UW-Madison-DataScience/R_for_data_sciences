**Learning Objectives:** After completing this material, an individual will be able to
do first steps to analyze data in `R`.

- correlate measurements and compare across groups using linear models
- develop annotated plots that reflect project design
- organize linear model results with [broom](https://github.com/tidyverse/broom), [car](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/car/index.html), or [lsmeans](https://github.com/rvlenth/lsmeans) packages
- clustering and trees, building networks
- [network](analyze/network/README.md) observations in connected graphs
