These are examples using two network visualization packages in R.
First run `network_data.Rmd` to get data files. Then run igraph or visNetwork Rmd's to learn how to use these.

base name | details
--------- | ---------
[network_data](network_data.Rmd) | set up network data
[network_igraph](network_igraph.Rmd) | igraph example with dataset 1
[network2_igraph](network2_igraph.Rmd) | igraph example with dataset 2
[network_visNetwork](network_visNetwork.Rmd) | visNetwork example with dataset 1

The `network_data.Rmd` file will download the ZIP file, data files, and Katya Ognyanova's tutorial as PDF and R. See **Network Visualization with R**, [Polnet 2016](http://www.kateto.net/polnet2016) by Katya Ognyanova. Katya discusses other packages as well as igraph and visNetwork.
