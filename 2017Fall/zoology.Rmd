This is a 30-45 minute session on data wrangling, primarily with the `dplyr` package.
Material is drawn from the "Aggregating and analyzing data with dplyr" session that is part of the 2-day [Data Carpentry](http://www.datacarpentry.com) workshop taught on campus several times a year.

Websites for the January 2018 workshops can be found at these addresses. Registration opens for BOTH on December 11 at 5:00.
