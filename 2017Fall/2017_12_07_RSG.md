## 2017-12-07 Connecting Data Tools Beyond R

This is basically an overview of how to [connect beyond R](../connect/README.md):

- use [unix/linux shell](linux.md) to search and modify project
- build a basic pipeline or workflow in the shell
- high throughput computing

## 2017-12-07 <a name="analyze">Analyzing Data with Linear and Other Models</a>

This is an overview of [analyzing data with R](../analyze/README.md):

- correlate measurements and compare across groups using linear models
- develop annotated plots that reflect project design
- organize linear model results with [broom](https://github.com/tidyverse/broom), [car](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/car/index.html), or [lsmeans](https://github.com/rvlenth/lsmeans) packages
- clustering and trees, building networks
- models that are not linear: generalized linear models, non-linear models
- formulas

We will go over the examples on [co-relate variables (columns) of data](../analyze/correlate.Rmd) and [how do columns co-vary together](../analyze/covary.Rmd).
Given interest, we will talk about [details of formula in R](../analyze/Formulas.Rmd)

Advanced readers will want to look on the page about [linear models](linear_models.Rmd).
