Everyone (especially beginners):

-   This unit is about [Profiling Code for Errors and Simulations](https://github.com/datascience-uwmadison/R_for_data_sciences/tree/master/profile) in a variety of ways
-   We will also talk more about [functions](https://github.com/datascience-uwmadison/R_for_data_sciences/blob/master/organize/function.Rmd)

Experienced R folks should explore the
[profile](https://github.com/datascience-uwmadison/R_for_data_sciences/tree/master/profile) folder,
in particular:

- go through [Advanced R by Hadley Wickham (ebook)](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/): [Performance](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Performance.html) & [Profiling](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Profiling.html)
- [profile](profile.Rmd) code to identify bottlenecks and logic errors
    + traceback, browser, [Rmarkdown breakpoints](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/205612627-Debugging-with-RStudio)
    + [Rprof](https://www.r-bloggers.com/profiling-r-code/), [profviz](https://rstudio.github.io/profvis/)
    + [Optimizing code](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Profiling.html)
    + package build and checking; TravisCI
- [simulate](simulate.Rmd) data to study statistical properties
    + examine speed of simulations
    + simulate linear model fits
