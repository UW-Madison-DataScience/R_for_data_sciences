Everyone:

-   The [curate overview](https://github.com/datascience-uwmadison/R_for_data_sciences/blob/master/curate.md) provides a range of topics on curating data. In the study group, I will only cover a small part of this.
-   I assume at this point that all are familiar with the beginning of [basic introduction to R](http://kbroman.org/datacarpentry_R_2017-01-10/01-intro-to-R.html). I will reintroduce the surveys data and go over <https://github.com/datascience-uwmadison/R\_for\_data\_sciences/blob/master/curate.Rmd> the section on "Indexing, Sequences, and Subsetting".

Beginners:

-   I will go over [Aggregating and analyzing data with dplyr](http://kbroman.org/datacarpentry_R_2017-01-10/02-dplyr.html). This is the full document. I will work directly from the more condensed [notes](http://kbroman.org/datacarpentry_R_2017-01-10/02-notes.html).

Experienced R folks:

-   Explore the [curate](https://github.com/datascience-uwmadison/R_for_data_sciences/tree/master/curate) folder, in particular:
    +   [Working with data tables in R](https://github.com/datascience-uwmadison/R_for_data_sciences/blob/master/curate/data_tables.Rmd) gives an overview of split-apply-combine tools
    +   [Tidyverse split-apply-combine example](https://github.com/datascience-uwmadison/R_for_data_sciences/blob/master/curate/tidyverse.Rmd) uses dplyr, tidyr & purrr on survyes
    +   [purrr example using map & transpose](https://github.com/datascience-uwmadison/R_for_data_sciences/blob/master/curate/purrr.Rmd) will get you into purrr
    +   [more tidyverse on portal\_mammals data](https://github.com/datascience-uwmadison/R_for_data_sciences/blob/master/curate/species.Rmd) uses
    dplyr, tidyr & purrr (but I have my own local surveys.csv and species.csv files in ../data folder)

-   If you don't know dplyr well, focus on that. If you do, learn something about purrr.
-   If you want to dig deeper, look in chapters of Hadley's books: [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz) chapters on [Data Transformation](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html) (dplyr) &
    [Vectors](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/vectors.html) (purrr) and
    [Advanced R](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/).

On beyond:

-   the [curate overview](https://github.com/datascience-uwmadison/R_for_data_sciences/blob/master/curate.md) points
    to information on handling character strings, and creating
    functions, as well as reading/writing files. Frankly, the latter two
    documents are under-developed, but I am happy to talk about that if
    there is time and interest.
