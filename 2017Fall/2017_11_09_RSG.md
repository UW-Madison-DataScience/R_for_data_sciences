Everyone (especially beginners):

-   This unit is about [organizing data tasks](https://github.com/datascience-uwmadison/R_for_data_sciences/tree/master/organize) in a variety of ways
-   The main goal today is learning how to document ongoing work with <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/>

-   We will go over the [Data Carpentry lesson](http://www.datacarpentry.org/lessons/) on [Reports with Rmarkdown](http://kbroman.org/datacarpentry_R_2017-01-10/04-rmarkdown.html)

-   build your own Rmarkdown page
-   use the [Rmarkdown Example page](https://github.com/datascience-uwmadison/R_for_data_sciences/blob/master/organize/RmarkdownExample.Rmd)

-   If we have time, we can discuss [functions](https://github.com/datascience-uwmadison/R_for_data_sciences/blob/master/organize/function.Rmd)

This session is best done hands on. Have a machine with the latest
versions of [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) and [Rstudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/%23download) on it.
Even better fire up Rstudio and click the green circle with white
plus (upper left corner) and try creating an "R Markdown" (HTML format)
or "R Notebook" page. You might be asked to install some packages at
that point – do it. If you are adventurous, try clicking the "Preview"
or "Knit" icon at the top of the page to see what is produced. Again,
you may be asked to install some packages, which you should. If you get
stuck, don't worry, as we will go over this in class.

Experienced R folks should explore the
[organize](https://github.com/datascience-uwmadison/R_for_data_sciences/tree/master/organize) folder,
in particular:

-   learn more about document creation from links on my
    [Rmarkdown](https://github.com/datascience-uwmadison/R_for_data_sciences/blob/master/organize/Rmarkdown.mdA) page

-   Note especially [Karl Broman's knitr in a
    knutshell](http://kbroman.org/knitr_knutshell/)

-   create
    [functions](https://github.com/datascience-uwmadison/R_for_data_sciences/blob/master/organize/function.Rmd) to
    collapse repeated steps into one-line “verbs”
-   use [git and github](https://github.com/datascience-uwmadison/R_for_data_sciences/blob/master/organize/github.md) to keep track of code and document changes with version control
-   organize functions, documentation and data into [packages](https://github.com/datascience-uwmadison/R_for_data_sciences/blob/master/organize/package.Rmd) (R libraries) to share
-   create and manage external [databases](https://github.com/datascience-uwmadison/R_for_data_sciences/blob/master/organize/database.md) with R objects

-   See also the
    [References](https://github.com/datascience-uwmadison/R_for_data_sciences/blob/master/reference.md) page

Section headers can have levels

\# First level heading

\#\# Second level heading

\#\#\# 3rd level heading

…

Side note: If you keep going too much the headers will be smaller than
your text. :-O

Markdown in gmail:

Never tried this one but looks interesting -
<https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/markdown-here/elifhakcjgalahccnjkneoccemfahfoa?hl=en>

This one does lots of things besides just markdown -
<https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mixmax-email-tracking-tem/ocpljaamllnldhepankaeljmeeeghnid?hl=en>

Little gear to the top right in a code chunk will help you to change the
settings of that chunk (give it a name, turn off warnings, etc.)

Can run individual chunks with the little play button to the top right
of the code chunk to run only that chunk in your workspace instead of
knitting the whole document

Can also change the code chunks to different languages (python, bash,
etc.) - <https://yihui.name/knitr/demo/engines/>

Can use pandoc alone to write documents without code (or with code notes
- but it won’t run the code like Rmd does) - <https://pandoc.org/>

-   Example - Sarah’s committee meeting report in markdown
    <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sstevens2/MDTP/master/5YCM/5YCM\_Report.md> and the rendered pdf version <https://github.com/sstevens2/MDTP/blob/master/5YCM/5YCM\_Report.pdf>
-   Sarah uses it because it is easy to version control and with make
    can be very automated.
