Object oriented approach has become more popular

-   Design is smarter and cleaner
-   Operations on TABLES instead of CELLS
-   Reproducible workflows are keys

-   "Your closest collaborator is you 6 months ago, and they don't
    answer emails"
-   \#\# Comments are important
-   Work so that you don’t have to reinvent the wheel later on

Data Carpentry Workshop page that Brian brought up from Aug.  You should
go through this if you are feeling super lost today.

Also, we host this workshop and a Software Carpentry one here on campus
before every semester. Sign up for the ACI list serv here
<http://aci.wisc.edu> for lots of computational resources on campus and info about the DC/SWC
workshops.  You \*might\* also get info about these from the ComBEE
listserv.

Ask questions! - Type them in here if you are too shy

What is the difference between R and Rstudio?

-   R is the programming language itself where Rstudio is an awesome
    graphical user interface where you can interact with R.  It is the
    most popular interface for R and has lots of great built in
    functions that make learning/using R easier for you.
-   RStudio 1.1 was recently released with an awesome all black theme:

    a terminal view:

-   You can also change the color of your console and script pane in the
    older versions by adjusting your preferences. ;) Though +1 for
    updating! (I like ALL black :P) (I’m boring and like default --MC)

Factors = different levels within categorical data (e.g. “Dog, Cat” for
“Species”) R often reads in any strings/words/characters as
factors(expecting that they are categorical) but it is storing them as
‘levels’(which are numbers) behind the scenes.

NOTE: Just because something is a “number” doesn’t mean you necessarily
want it to be “numeric”. Example: ID Numbers are categorical. Or months!

`str(data.frame)` will give you the structure of your dataframe.
