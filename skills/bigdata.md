## Big Data

Big data refers to a collection of data sets so large and complex that
it becomes difficult to process using on-hand database management tools
or traditional data processing applications. That is, beyond current
comfort levels. Big data made a splash in 2012, but it is now recognized
that “big” is relative, depending on context, amount of data and
complexity of the problem. Gartner glibly identified the “3 Vs” of big
data--[volume, velocity and
variety](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data)-- which were recently
expanded by Inderpal Bhandar to include another 3 Vs: [veracity,
validity and
volatility](http://inside-bigdata.com/2013/09/12/beyond-volume-variety-velocity-issue-big-data-veracity/).
Statisticians, and data modellers in general, might also want to include
3 Us: unknowns, uncertainty, and unfamiliarity. Below is a compilation
of links related to big data.
