Subjects for Traditional and Non-traditional Programs
-----------------------------------------------------

Our department, in collaboration with other units on campus, has
research expertise in several subjects that are “marketable”. We could
enhance our traditional programs by offering new (or in some cases
retooled) courses in these areas, including:

1.  Core Graduate Studies: Graduate programs at other institutions,
    particularly outside the US, want to send students to UW-Madison to
    learn our core graduate sequence. This training would enhance their
    in-country degree programs. This may best be served by a capstone
    certificate with 609-610 or 709-710 and 849-850.
2.  Uncertainty Quantification: Teach the quantitative characterization
    and reduction of uncertainties in applications. Focus on methods to
    determine how likely certain outcomes are in partially understood
    systems. Focus is on computer simulation modeling of complex
    systems. Develop this closely with faculty in other data science
    fields, notably CS and College of Engineering.
3.  Inference for Systems Genetics: We have several faculty who are
    involved in short course instruction at other institutions. We could
    readily develop our own Summer (Jun-Aug) or Winter (Jan) short
    course on this topic, likely drawing on faculty in Genetics and BMI.
4.  Mathematical/Statistical Finance: Core foundations (311-312 or 431)
    would be coupled with specialized courses in mathematical or
    statistical finance (to be developed). New courses could focus
    quickly on the study of spatio-temporal patterns (time series,
    GPS-like data structures) essential in financial decision making.
    This would ideally be done jointly with Mathematics and School of
    Business.
5.  [Data Analytics](/analytics)
