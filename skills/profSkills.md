## Professional Skills for Data Science

These materials are for statisticians at all levels who want to learn
more about modern network and computing tools for statistics. The course
for Fall 2015 is: Stat 627 Professional Skills for Data Science (1-2 cr,
Thursdays 1-2:15pm, 1010 MSC). [This is NOT the Stat 327 "Data Analysis
with R" course.] This is recommended for all new graduate students. It
will emphasize training in best practices with R, focusing on how to
organize your work (using Rstudio), how to build excellent graphics
(using ggplot2) and how to document your work (using R markdown), among
other things. This is being led by Brian Yandell and Doug Bates in Fall
2015; see [moodle
site](https://ay15-16.moodle.wisc.edu/prod/local/wiscservices/login/index.php),
[Stat 627 Syllabus](/~yandell/data_science/Stat627Syllabus.pdf) and
[Jenny Bryan's Stat 545 at UBC](http://stat545-ubc.github.io). The
course covers

-   installation of the RStudio application on personal computers and
    use of RStudio on departmental computers.
-   Representation of data in R, including factors and data frames.
-   Manipulation and display of data in R.
-   Visualization of data with the ggplot2 package for R.
-   The "R Markdown" language for literate programming and reproducible
    research.
-   The R formula language and its use for fitting linear models and
    generalized linear models.
-   Contrast specifications for factors and their impact on
    interpretation of coefficient estimates.

The raw material for Fall 2014 was at https://github.com/dmbates/stat692
with more material in [Yandell's Stat 692
Notes](/network-skills/stat692-notes) related to Bates's talks.

following network tools to deliver information:

We are in the age of [big data](bigdata.md), when it is not enough to
think of what you can do with the computer on your desk or lap. Further,
statistics as a field is being transformed by [analytics](programs.md),
the process of discovery and communication of meaningful patterns in
data. Today, statisticians of all flavors--from the most pragmatic to
the most theoretical--need a variety of computational tools, and we need
access to vast resources across computer networks. While many of us work
in closed shops, behind proprietary walls, the world of open source is
core to sharing methods and information. Thus, it is important to
understand the power and role of the [linux](http://www.linux.org)
operating system and of the [R](http://www.r-project.org) language.
However, these only the beginning. While we focus on computational
skills, communication is key to the field of statistics, and to science
in general. And visualization is at the core of communicating complex
ideas, providing a window of insight into the world of data. Today, much
communication is online, and we must learn how to leverage online data
and network tools to advance in the field, and to do our work
effectively.
